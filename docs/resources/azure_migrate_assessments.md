## Examples

### Loop through migrate assessments by their names

```ruby
azure_migrate_assessments(resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME'.names.each do |name|
  describe azure_container_group (resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME', group_name: 'GROUP_NAME', name: name) do
    it { should exist }
  end
end
```

### Test to ensure migrate assessments exist with local redundancy

```ruby
describe azure_migrate_assessments(resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME').where(azureStorageRedundancy: 'LocallyRedundant') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exists

```ruby
# Should not exist if no Migrate Assessments are present in the project and in the resource group
describe azure_migrate_assessments(resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME') do
  it { should_not exist }
end

# Should exist if the filter returns at least one Migrate Assessment in the project and in the resource group
describe azure_migrate_assessments(resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Azure Permissions

Your [Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal) must be set up with a `contributor` role on the subscription you wish to test.
