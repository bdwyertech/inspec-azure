## Examples

### Loop through migrate project events by their names

```ruby
azure_migrate_project_events(resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME').names.each do |name|
  describe azure_migrate_project_event(resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME', name: `PROJECT_EVENT_NAME`) do
    it { should exist }
  end
end
```

### Test that there are migrate project events for databases

```ruby
describe azure_migrate_project_events(resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME').where(instanceType: 'Databases') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

describe azure_migrate_project_events(resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
# Should exist, if the filter returns at least one migrate project events in the project and in the resource group
describe azure_migrate_project_events(resource_group: 'RESOURCE_GROUP', project_name: 'PROJECT_NAME') do
  it { should exist }
end
